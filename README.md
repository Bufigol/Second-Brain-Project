# Second Brain Framework Application

## üöÄ Empowering Personal Knowledge Management

The Second Brain Framework application is a cross-platform personal knowledge management system designed to help you capture, organize, and connect your thoughts and ideas effectively. Inspired by the "Building a Second Brain" methodology, this application aims to provide a robust and intuitive environment for managing your personal knowledge base.

## üåü Key Features

-   **Systematic Information Capture:** Effortlessly gather notes, ideas, and insights from various sources.
-   **Atomic Note Management:** Create and manage small, self-contained notes focused on a single concept, promoting clarity and reusability.
-   **Semantic Connections:** Establish meaningful relationships between notes, enabling you to discover new insights and patterns in your knowledge.
-   **Cross-Platform Availability:** Seamlessly access and synchronize your knowledge base across web and mobile platforms.
-   **Intuitive User Interface:** Enjoy a clean and user-friendly interface designed for focused knowledge work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This application is built using a combination of modern technologies:

-   **Backend:** Ruby on Rails - Provides a robust and scalable API for handling data and business logic.
-   **Databases:**
    -   MySQL - Used for structured data, such as user information, project details, and tags.
    -   MongoDB - Used for flexible and schema-less storage of atomic notes, allowing for rich content and metadata.
-   **Mobile:** Java (Android) - Powers the native Android mobile application, providing offline access and device-specific features.
-   **Web:** JavaScript (React/Next.js) - Delivers a responsive and interactive web experience, enabling access from any modern browser.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `sql_scripts/`: Contains SQL scripts for setting up the MySQL database, including schema definitions, migrations, and seed data.
-   `backend_rails/`: Houses the Ruby on Rails API backend, including models, controllers, services, and tests.
-   `mobile_java/`: Contains the Java codebase for the Android mobile application, implementing MVVM architecture and local storage.
-   `frontend_web/`: Holds the JavaScript codebase for the React-based web application, leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
-   `project_misc/`: A collection of project-related documentation, including this README, the Contributing guidelines, the Security Policy, the Code of Conduct, a sample License, and the Development Roadmap.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

To get started with the Second Brain Framework application, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```
2.  **Configure databases:**
    -   Set up MySQL and create the necessary database schema using the provided `sql_scripts`.
    -   Set up MongoDB and create the necessary collections.
    -   Update the `database.yml` files in the `backend_rails` project with your database credentials.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend_rails` directory and install the Ruby gems: `bundle install`.
    -   Navigate to the `frontend_web` directory and install the npm dependencies: `npm install`.
    -   Navigate to the `mobile_java` directory and set up your Android development environment.
4.  **Execute database migrations:**
    -   In the `backend_rails` directory, run `rails db:migrate` to apply database migrations.
    -   You may need to populate the database with seed data: `rails db:seed`.
