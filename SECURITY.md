# üîí Security Policy for Second Brain Framework

This document outlines the security practices and policies for the Second Brain Framework project. As a project in its early stages, we are particularly focused on establishing a solid security foundation. We are committed to protecting the security and privacy of our users' data and ensuring the integrity of our platform as it develops.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

We adhere to the following security principles:

-   **Confidentiality:** Protecting sensitive user information and preventing unauthorized access.
-   **Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of user data.
-   **Availability:** Maintaining the reliability and accessibility of the application.
-   **Privacy:** Respecting user privacy and complying with relevant data protection regulations.
-   **Least Privilege:** Granting only the necessary permissions to users and components.

## üí° Security Measures

We are actively implementing the following security measures to protect our users and their data. Please note that as a new project, these measures will evolve and improve over time.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
-   **Secure Authentication:** We are implementing industry-standard authentication mechanisms, likely including JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to securely authenticate users.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** We are working on implementing RBAC to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles.
-   **Secure Password Storage:** We will hash passwords using secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and store them in our database.

### 2. Data Security
-   **Encryption in Transit:** We will use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the user's device and our servers.
-   **Encryption at Rest:** We plan to encrypt sensitive data at rest in our databases using appropriate encryption algorithms.
-   **Data Validation and Sanitization:** We will validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
-   **Secure File Uploads:** We will implement secure file upload mechanisms and validate file types.

### 3. Application Security
-   **Vulnerability Scanning:** We will conduct vulnerability scans as part of our development process to identify potential security weaknesses in our code.
-   **Code Reviews:** We will perform code reviews to identify security flaws and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
-   **Dependency Management:** We will manage our dependencies carefully and promptly apply security patches to prevent vulnerabilities.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** We will plan for regular security audits as the project matures.
-   **Secure APIs:** We are developing our APIs with security best practices in mind.
-   **Protection Against Common Web Attacks:** We will implement measures to prevent common attacks, including CSRF, XSS, and Clickjacking.

### 4. Mobile Security
-   **Secure Data Storage:** We will use secure storage mechanisms to store data locally on mobile devices.
-   **Mobile App Hardening:** We will take steps to harden our mobile app to prevent reverse engineering and tampering.
-   **Secure Communication:** We will ensure secure communication between the mobile app and the backend using HTTPS.

### 5. Database Security
-   **Access Control:** We will restrict database access to authorized personnel only.
-   **Database Encryption:** We will encrypt sensitive data stored in our databases.
-   **Regular Backups:** We will implement regular database backups.
-   **Database Auditing:** We will enable database auditing as appropriate.

### 6. Infrastructure Security
-   **Secure Server Configuration:** We will configure our servers following security best practices.
-   **Regular Security Updates:** We will apply regular security updates to our operating systems and infrastructure components.
-   **Network Security:** We will use firewalls and other security measures to protect our network.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a new project, our versioning scheme is still under development. For now, consider all releases as potentially subject to security updates and improvements.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
|  0.x.x  | :white_check_mark: |

*Note: This will be updated as the project evolves and more stable releases become available.*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Second Brain Framework, please report it to us immediately by:

-   Sending an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) (Replace with a real email address for your project).
-   Creating a private security vulnerability issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues) (Make sure to make it a private security advisory).

**Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until we have had a chance to address them.**

We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours. Given the early stage of the project, our response times for fixing vulnerabilities may vary, but we will keep you informed of our progress. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and your help in making the Second Brain Framework secure as it grows.

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, here‚Äôs what you can expect:

-   **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.
-   **Evaluation:** We will assess the reported vulnerability and its impact.
-   **Response:** We will provide updates on the assessment and remediation status.
-   **Resolution:** We will prioritize and fix the vulnerability.
-   **Notification:** We will notify you once the vulnerability has been fixed and deployed, as appropriate.

If we determine that a reported issue is not a security vulnerability, we will also explain our reasoning.

## üìú Changes to This Security Policy

We may update this security policy from time to time as our security practices evolve. Any changes will be posted on this page and will be effective immediately upon posting.
